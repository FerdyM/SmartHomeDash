# SmartHomeDash

This is a modular custom dashboard designed to help you easily monitor and control your custom Smarthome devices. What is live is only an example and intended to demonstrate the User Interface, for full functionality you will need to connect the backend.

I am intending to continue to grow and add to this project both as I become better at development and as I delve farther into the world of IoT and create more devices.
